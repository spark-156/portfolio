    React
    <br />
    <br />
    After getting myself familiar with default JavaScript DOM manipulation I turned my eye to my very first framework. I didnâ€™t have to look much further than the list of the most popular JS front end frameworks. In the end I learned React by following a course on CodeCademy of which I now have a certificate.

    I have worked with React on many projects in school and have learned that I like working with typescript React the most. As it allows for faster less buggy development.

export default defineComponent({

  components: {
    'colored-background-div-vue': ColoredBackgroundDivVue,
